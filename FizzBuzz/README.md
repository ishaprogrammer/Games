# FizzBuzz Program

The FizzBuzz program is a classic coding exercise that prints numbers from 1 to a specified target (in this case, 100). However, for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz," and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz." If a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."

## How to Run the Program

1. **Requirements:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or IDE.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will print the numbers from 1 to 100, following the FizzBuzz rules.
